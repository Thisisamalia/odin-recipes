    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These dinner rolls bake up fluffy and golden with just a hint of sweetness. Brush warm rolls with melted butter just before serving.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope Fleischmann's RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, plus more for brushing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine ¾ cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat milk, water, and 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F).</li>
        <li>Add warm milk mixture to the flour mixture. Beat for 2 minutes on medium speed of an electric mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally. Add ¼ cup flour; beat for 2 minutes at high speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. Cover; let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Shape pieces into balls and place in a greased 8-inch round pan. Cover and let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush with melted butter if you like.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
